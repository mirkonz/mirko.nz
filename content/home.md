## Kia Ora & welcome to my website **mirko.nz**

## I’m a UI Engineer living in Wellington, New Zealand, sworking at the intersection of design, engineering, and systems thinking. My focus is on building scalable, intuitive, and resilient design systems that empower teams and enhance digital experiences.


* Precision in design.
* Systems-driven thinking.
* Engineering for the future.

I believe that great design is not just about aesthetics, but about clarity, efficiency, and intent. It’s about reducing friction, enabling creativity, and ensuring that technology serves people—not the other way around.
